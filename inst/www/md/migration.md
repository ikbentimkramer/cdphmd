This indicator is visualised in two ways. First, the map on the left shows the relative change of population numbers per municipality in 2019 in the reference to the value from 2015. The bar graph on the right shows the increase/decrease in population per municipality during the period 2015 to 2019. The dropdown menu can be used to select a province.
