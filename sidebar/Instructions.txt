Hey, so I've tried to create a sidebar menu that will display the housing stock for municipalities of Groningen and Drenthe.
I found it as a very tidious task, and it is still in progress.
I think the way I added this input is very messy, I def need to improve the way I add my input, 
hence this instructions/remarks.
I don't know if you need it, but in case you face issues to recreate what I did, here it is.

1) I still did not figure out how to read data from json, may be you can help me with that. So I read it from a csv.
For now, I uploaded the data set on the git in the folder datasets, both in .csv and .json.

2) Run housing_stock_data_municipalities.R with the dataset I uploaded.
3) Run Clean_plot.R
4) replace main_ui_withsidebar with the original main_ui
5) Run shiny
